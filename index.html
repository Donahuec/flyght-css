    Flyght CSS is <strong>very</strong> in progress. Expect things to change
    rapidly, as well as various layouts and pages to be incomplete or not up to
    standard as is is developed. This is a personal project created by one
    person, largely for the purpose of learning more advanced css. Don't expect
    the same production ready status and polish of larger more supported
    libraries.
